</ul>
<h2 id="modality">Modality</h2>
<p>I'm excited to be back on campus and to teach in-person once again, and I've
heard from many students who feel the same way. Still, I understand that the
pandemic continues and that a good number of students may be unable to come to
campus or may feel uncomfortable doing so.</p>
<p>As a result, I am structuring the course so that you will have the option to
take it remotely or in-person (or a mixture of both). In particular, lectures
will be delivered in-person at the regularly scheduled time and location, but I
will not be taking attendance. The lecture content will be podcasted so that you
will not need to be physically present to keep up-to-date. Exams, too, will be
held remotely. Office hours will be offered in a mix of in-person and remote
modalities. Because no component of the course will require physical attendance,
you will not need to let us know or do anything extra in order to take the class
remotely (or in-person, for that matter).</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started in DSC 80, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.</p>
<h3 id="campuswire">Campuswire</h3>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/p/GAD6BC3AF">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties. You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you should get in
touch with a course staff member as soon as possible, as we'll be making all
course announcements via Campuswire.</p>
<p>If you have a question about anything to do with the course  &mdash; if you're stuck on a
assignment problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general question
about data science &mdash; you can make a post on Campuswire. We only ask that if your
question includes some or all of an answer, please make your post <strong>private</strong> so that
others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously if you would prefer.</p>
<p>Course staff will regularly check Campuswire and try to answer any questions that you
have. You're also encouraged to answer a question asked by another student if you
feel that you know the answer.</p>
<h3 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h3>
<p>We'll be using 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/316836">Gradescope</a> for
assignment submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be coding assignments.
Parts of these assignments will be manually graded, but most of them will be autograded.
You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not please
let us know as soon as possible (preferably via Campuswire).</p>
<h3 id="canvas">Canvas</h3>
<p>I'll use <a href="http://canvas.ucsd.edu">Canvas</a> to display your overall course grade at the
end of the quarter, but that's it; everything else will be available at
<a href="http://dsc80.com">dsc90.com</a> or <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/316836">Gradescope</a>.</p>
<h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>
<p>No materials are required for this course; we'll use lecture slides as the main
resource, as well as the <a href="https://afraenkel.github.io/practical-data-science/introduction">course
notes</a> written by Prof.
Aaron Fraenkel.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<p>Lectures will be held in-person at the regularly-scheduled time and place, but
they will be podcasted and posted online for remote viewing. Attendance is
appreciated, but not required.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
<p>Course staff, including tutors, TAs, and instructors, will hold office hours
regularly throughout the week.
Office hours will be offered in a mix of in-person and remote
modalities. 
Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office hours</a> page for
the schedule and for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="discussions">Discussions</h2>
<p>Discussions will be held in-person at 
03:00 pm PST on Friday
in
CENTR 113.</p>
<p>Attendance is recommended, but not required. The discussions will be podcasted,
but the nature of discussion section (they usually involve a large amount of
groupwork) means that the podcasted discussion might not be as useful as
in-person attendance as in-person attendance.</p>
<p>During discussion you will work through a short notebook or coding problem designed to
prepare you for the coming week's assignments. Attending discussion and
submitting the discussion assignment are <em>not</em> mandatory. However, each discussion
assignment submitted will earn you 0.3% of <strong>extra credit üéâ</strong> applied towards your overall
score at the end of the quarter. Since there will be 10 discussions, there will be 3% of
extra credit made available. This has the potential to boost your grade by half a letter.</p>
<p>Discussion assignments will be due via Gradescope on midnight of the Saturday after
discussion.</p>
<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<p>There will be <strong>nine lab assignments</strong> due weekly throughout the quarter. Each lab
assignment will be a mixture of coding and free response questions. Coding questions
will ask you to fill in the body of a function. Doctests are usually provided so that
you can make sure that you're on the right track (<em>a la</em> DSC 20), however, your
submission will be graded using a private autograder with hidden tests.</p>
<p>Each lab is worth the same amount, but the lowest lab will be dropped when calculating
your final score.</p>
<p>Lab assignments are eligible for <strong>redemption</strong> with the following scheme. If
you re-submit your lab within one week of the due date, we'll regrade it with a
10% penalty. If you re-submit it between one and two weeks after the due date,
there will be a 30% penalty. Beyond this we cannot accept redemption requests. A
special Gradescope assignment will be created for each lab redemption -- to
submit your redemption, just submit your updated solutions to this Gradescope
assignment. Note that the lab solutions will be posted while you work on your
redemption, and while you're encouraged to look at the solutions, you should
never copy code. We recommend spending at least an hour between looking at the
solutions and working on your redemption.</p>
<p>In DSC 80, we want to get as much practice as possible with the tools of the trade,
including <code>git</code>. Therefore, all assignments -- labs included -- are obtained by
pulling the course <a href="https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2021-fa">GitHub repository</a></p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>There will be <strong>five projects</strong> due every other week throughout the quarter. Like labs,
projects consist of coding and free response questions. As their name implies, however,
projects are more open-ended and allow you to simulate applying your data science skills
in practical situations. You can think of the projects as being mini-take-home-exams
that track your <em>practical</em> skills throughout the quarter (whereas the exams themselves
test for conceptual understanding).</p>
<p>Projects are due bi-weekly. However, the week <em>before</em> a project is due, there
will (usually) be a <em>project checkpoint</em>. This checkpoint will ensure that
you're on-track to complete the project on time, and should (hopefully) be a
source of easy points.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike labs, projects are not eligible for redemption, nor is the lowest
project dropped. Like all assignments, you can obtain the project by pulling from the
course GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The last project will be due during finals week, and can be thought of as a practical
component of the final exam.</p>
<h3 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h3>
<p>You may work together on projects using the paradigm of <em>pair programming</em>. In pair
programming, you may work with <em>one</em> partner of your choosing to complete the
assignment. You must both be present (physically or virtually), and working on the same
piece of code simultaneously. One person types while the other watches for errors. Pair
programming is <strong>not</strong> where one person does Question 1 while the other person does
Question 2.</p>
<p>If you choose to pair program a project, you must submit the project as a pair (even if
you do just a single problem together). You must also submit the project <em>checkpoint</em>
together (as otherwise you'd be working separately on part of the project).</p>
<p>Note that you may not pair program on lab assignments.</p>
<h2 id="slip-days">Slip Days</h2>
<p>You have <strong>five slip days</strong> to use throughout the quarter on <em>any</em> deadline, including a
discussion assignment, lab, project, or project checkpoint.
A slip day extends the
deadline of any one assignment by 24 hours. Slip days cannot be "stacked" or "combined" to
extend the deadline further &mdash;
the latest any one assignment can be submitted is 24 hours after the deadline.
Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, but it's your
responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in
deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its
original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slips days are also meant for things
like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to submit your assignment. Slip
days are to be used in exceptional circumstances, so you probably shouldn't get
close to using all five ‚Äî if you feel that you will need that many, send me a
message and we'll figure something out.</p>
<h2 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h2>
<p>Most of the projects and labs are autograded, but some questions are manually graded.
If you feel that there in an error in the autograder or that the manual grader has made
a mistake, you may submit a regrade request within <strong>one week</strong> of the grades being
released. To do so, please submit a private post to Campuswire. Note that part of your
grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may still not be
eligible for full credit.</p>
<h3 id="catastrophic-regrades">Catastrophic Regrades</h3>
<p>The autograder is very picky: it expects your assignments to have exactly the correct
file names, all functions must be named correctly, etc. If these are wrong, your code
may not run and the autograder may assign zero points. This is a <strong>grading
catastrophe üòß</strong>.</p>
<p>Grading catastrophes are preventable! After submitting your assignment,
always wait around to see the output of the Gradescope grader and ensure that it
runs properly. Also, be sure to submit your assignment (or at least part of it)
to Gradescope with enough time before the deadline to get help if there is a
strange autograder problem.</p>
<p>In the case that you submit code that doesn't run and discover this at a later date, you
have some options:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it is still before the late deadline, you may use a slip day to fix your
   code and re-submit. Note that you're free to do this even if your code runs -- this
   is just making use of the normal slip day mechanism to submit an assignment late.</li>
<li>If it is past the late deadline <strong>and</strong> your code requires only minor fixes
   (e.g., the file name is wrong) we will fix your code at the cost of <strong>two</strong> slip days.
   You must have two full slip days to use this option!</li>
</ol>
<p>To submit a catastrophic regrade request, please make a private Campuswire post.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>There will be a midterm exam and a final exam:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm</strong>: Monday, November 01 (covers Lectures 01 &mdash; 10)</li>
<li><strong>Final</strong>: Tuesday, December 07  (cumulative)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exams will not be at a specific time.
Instead, there will be a window of 24 hours during which you can start your exam, but once your
exam is started you will have 90 minutes to finish it.</p>
<h3 id="passing-threshold">Passing Threshold</h3>
<p>In order to pass the class, you must get at least 55% on the final exam.  Note that this
is the case even if your other grades are good. For example, if you receive an "A" on
the first midterm, have a assignment average of "A", but receive less, you cannot pass the
class.</p>
<p>The reason behind this policy is that receiving below a 55% on the final indicates a
significant misunderstanding in a core aspect of the course; since DSC 80 is a itself a
core course in the data science major, passing with such a gap in understanding will
likely affect your ability to understand and succeed in future courses.</p>
<h2 id="grading-scheme">Grading Scheme</h2>
<p>We'll be using the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>25%: Labs (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>30%: Projects </li>
<li>5%: Project Checkpoints </li>
<li>15%: Midterm </li>
<li>25%: Final </li>
<li>3% extra credit: Discussions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="support-and-resources">Support and Resources</h2>
<p>As an instructor, my job is to foster an environment where everyone, regardless
of identity, feels welcome and is able to focus on learning. If there is
something we can do in this mission, or if there is something preventing you
from succeeding in the class, please let us know. If you feel uncomfortable
speaking with us or are searching for help on a specific
concern, there are several campus resources
available to you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://caps.ucsd.edu/">UCSD Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thehub.ucsd.edu/">Hub Basic Needs Center</a></li>
<li><a href="https://osd.ucsd.edu/">Office for Students with Disability (OSD)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html">Office for Prevention of Sexual Harrassment and Discrimination</a></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, if you have <em>any</em> concerns about your ability to focus or
succeed in this course, or just need someone to talk to, <em>please</em> contact
us ASAP and we'll figure something out.</p>
<h3 id="illness">Illness</h3>
<p>Because of the pandemic, we must prepare for the unfortunate possibility that
you will get sick and be unable to participate in this class for long periods of
time.  The university has a mechanism for helping in this situation: the
<em>Incomplete</em>. If you are unable to complete the course because of reasons
outside of your control, you may be given an Incomplete instead of a letter grade. This
simply means that you will complete the rest of the work at a later time. Once you have
done so, your overall grade is calculated and your Incomplete grade is replaced.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
An Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed,
only to do work that hasn't been completed.
</div>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="is-this-class-curved">Is this class curved?</h3>
<p>The course is not usually curved at the end of the quarter.  Instead, I try to design
the assignments so that your final grade is predictable. In this quarter, the extra
credit from doing discussion assignments serves the same purpose as a curve.  When I
assign letter grades, the standard grading scale (where an A is 93+, A- is 90+, B+ is
87+, etc.) will be used as a starting point, but once all scores are in, I will run a
clustering algorithm to automatically find the best cutoffs for each letter grade. These
cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance, the threshold for an "A" will never be higher
