    "# Introduction to Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build *[statistical language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)* using public domain books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given \"language\" (the precise term is \"corpus\" or \"corpora\"). Here, \"language\" is a broad term that, in addition to the normal usage, may mean the language of a particular author or style. Applications of language models are found in areas such as language generation, authorship attribution, auto-complete / word-suggestion, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will learn about a simple but effective type of language model (LM) called N-gram models. Given a sentence (that is, a sequence of words $w = w_1\\ldots w_n$), you would like to understand the probability that sentence is used: \n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)$$\n",
    "However, sentences are built from words, and the likelihood that a word occurs where it does, depends on the words it follows. This points to using *conditional probability* to understand $P(w)$. That is, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This is also called the *chain rule* for probabilities.  \n",
    "**Example:** Consider the sentence $w = $ `when I eat pizza, I wipe off the grease.`\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\mbox{when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{ eat | when I})\\cdot P(\\mbox{ pizza | when I eat}) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot P(\\mbox{ grease | when I eat pizza, I wipe off the})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability that the sentence occurs is the product of the probability that each subsequent word follows the words that came before. For example, the probability $P(\\mbox{ pizza | when I eat})$ is pretty high, as pizza is something that you eat; thus, this term would contribute to this sentence having a higher probability of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram language models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the description above, the probability that any word in the sentence (e.g. 'grease') depends on *every* word that preceded it (e.g. 'when'). However, it's often the case the likelihood a word appears in a sentence is influenced more by *nearby* words. \n",
    "* N-gram language models capture this concept that only nearby words matter; they assume the probability a word occurs only depends on the previous $(Nâˆ’1)$ words. \n",
    "* That is, an N-gram model says: $P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: trigram model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence $w = $ `when I eat pizza, I wipe off the grease.`\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\mbox{when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{ eat | when I})\\cdot P(\\mbox{ pizza | I eat}) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot P(\\mbox{ the | wipe off}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{ grease | off the})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this example, we see the trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when considering the likelihood of the end word 'grease'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Given the descriptions and definitions above, we define the **N-grams of a text** to be the list of sliding windows of length N.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, the trigrams of the sentence $w$ in the example above are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'eat'), ('I', 'eat', 'pizza'), ... , ('wipe', 'off', 'the'), ('off', 'the', 'grease')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing an N-gram language model\n",
    "\n",
    "N-gram language models are a collection of conditional probabilities for sequences of words of length $N$. For example, in a trigram model, for every 3-word sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, you need to compute:\n",
    "$$P(w_1,w_2,w_3) = P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $C(w_1, w_2, w_3)$ is the number of occurrences of the trigram-sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$ in the dataset and $C(w_1, w_2)$ is the number of occurrences of the bigram-sequence  $w_1, w_2$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general N-gram model, the conditional probabilities are computed by dividing the counts of N-grams by the (N-1)-grams they follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the probabilities of a language model from a book requires breaking up the text of book into sequences of words. This process is called *tokenization*. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*. In this project tokens will include not only whole words, but also punctuation and other terms. Below are a few examples of other types of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation like `,.;'`. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. come before a `.` in an N-gram) and begin sentences (i.e. come after a `.` in an N-gram).\n",
    "* We have special 'START' and 'END' tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create our language model. Thus, you will use two ascii hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `\\x02` (used for 'beginning of text')\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `\\x03` (used for 'end of text')\n"
