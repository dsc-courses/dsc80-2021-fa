    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook.\n",

    "2. The notebook may be graded (if it contains free response questions or asks you to draw plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Labs will have public tests and private tests. The public \"smoke tests\" that you will run below and which appear on Gradescope are generally worth no points. After the due date, we will replace these tests with private tests that will determine your grade. This is different from DSC 10, where labs only had public tests!\n",
